	abstract = {The lower limit to the negative logarithmic relation between seed longevity and moisture content was determined in three subspecies of rice (Oryza satwa L.) by storing seeds of five cultivars at 65 °C with 11 different moisture contents (1.5–15.3\% f. wt) for various periods up to 150 d and then testing for germination. The estimates of the low-moisture-content limit (mc) were 4.3\% for subsp. indica, 4.4\% for subsp. japonica, and 4.5\% for subsp. javanica. These moisture contents were in equilibrium with 10.5—12.0\% r.h. No significant effect of moisture content between 1.5\% and mc on longevity was detected (P \&gt; 0.05), while between mc and 15.3\% there were negative logarithmic relations between longevity and moisture content. There were no significant differences in the relations between longevity and moisture either above or below mc between the two japonica cultivars or between the two javanica cultivars (P \&gt; 0.10). There was also no significant difference in the slope of the negative logarithmic relation between longevity and moisture above mc among the three subspecies (P \&gt; 0.25). However, there were significant differences in the standard deviation of the frequency distribution of seed deaths in time at any one moisture content, both above and below mc; this is a measure of seed longevity which is independent of pre-storage environment, and the differences observed show that there are genetically determined differences in longevity among the three subspecies (P \&lt; 0.005), indica being the longest and japonica the shortest lived. The results provide no evidence for intra-specific variation in mc and support the view that the maximum seed storage moisture content which provides the maximum longevity is that which is in equilibrium with about 10–11\% r.h. It is concluded that while the seed viability constant Cw of the seed viability equation is species specific and therefore applies to most, if not all, cultivars of rice, variation in the value of KE is the source of the differences in potential longevity of the three subspecies.},

In all cases the survival curves could be described by negative cumulative normal distributions. The longevity of the various seed lots differed but the value of the standard deviation (the reciprocal of which gives the slope of the survival curve when percentage germination is transformed to probit) was the same for all cultivars within a species when stored under similar conditions. Within each species the relative effects of moisture and temperature on longevity did not differ significantly between cultivars. In all three species there was a negative logarithmic relationship between seed moisture content and longevity, but the relative effect of moisture content differed between the species: differences in the longevity of soya bean seed as a function of moisture content were less than for either cowpea or chickpea. The relative effect of temperature on seed longevity did not differ between the three species, and the seed of all three species showed increasing temperature coefficients for the change in rate of loss of viability with increase in temperature. The complete pattern of loss in viability in all three species can be described by a single equation which was developed for barley and has also been shown to apply to onion seed. The constants applicable to the three grain legumes have been calculated so that it is now possible to predict percentage viability of any seed lot of these species after any storage period under a very wide range of storage conditions.},

	abstract = {Brachiaria brizantha (palisade grass) is a tropical forage grass species showing a high dormancy level in freshly harvested seeds. The main aims of this research work were to analyse the release of seed dormancy under controlled deterioration as well as to estimate viability constants, at moisture contents ranging from 3 to 20\% and variable storage periods (from one hour to 1,550 days, at 40, 50 and 65°C). Twelve seed sub samples for each moisture content/temperature combination were sealed in aluminium foil packets and stored in incubators at those temperatures, until completed survival curves were established. Germination tests were performed on intact and scarified (H2SO4, 15') seeds. The hazardous effect of the high storage temperatures seemed to be compensated by greater seed dormancy release, the best results being achieved at 50°C and 40°C for intact and scarified seeds, respectively, not taking into account seed moisture content. Estimated viability constants to predict seed longevity were: K E = 6.488, 8.795; C W = 4.480, 4.852; C H = 0.04750, 0.02114; CQ = 0.001292, 0.000733 for intact and scarified seeds, respectively.

In all 12 species investigated, relations between seed longevity and moisture content above a critical value were logarithmic, the value of the viability constant Cw (relative sensitivity of longevity to moisture) varying significantly (P \&lt; 0.025) amongst the species, from 4.5 in rape (Brassica napus) to 6.3 in mung bean (Vigna radiata). Ten of the 12 species showed no significant variation in longevity with further reduction in moisture content below a critical value, but in rice (Oryza saliva) and mung bean significant (P \&lt; 0.05), though only slight, negative and positive logarithmic relations, respectively, were detected between longevity and moisture contents below the critical value. The critical seed moisture content varied between 2.4\% in niger (Guizotia abyssinica) and 6.2\% in pea (Pisum sativum). Comparison between two cultivars of timothy (Phleum pratense) showed estimates of Cw and the critical moisture content to be invariant within the species. Variation in critical moisture content amongst species was correlated (P \&lt; 0.01) with variation in the value of Cw. The equilibrium relative humidity, and thus the water potential of the seeds at their various critical moisture contents, was similar, mean 10.6\% r.h. (s.e. 0.3). Accordingly, interspecific variation in the values of Cw and critical moisture content is ascribed to differences in seed composition. Moreover, in each species the critical moisture content coincided with the inflection point of the isotherm between seed moisture and equilibrium relative humidity. It follows that variation in longevity with variation in seed moisture content above the critical value results from variation in the weakly bound fraction of the water held within the seeds, while it appears that removal of the tightly bound water fraction does not influence the rate of seed deterioration. Above the critical moisture content we detected no significant difference (P \&gt; 0.25) in the relative sensitivity of seed longevity to change in equilibrium relative humidity amongst the 12 species, this being equivalent to a doubling of longevity for each 8.4\% reduction in equilibrium relative humidity, but further work is required to corroborate this tentative conclusion},

	abstract = {Genebank managers conduct viability tests on stored seeds so they can replace lots that have viability near a critical threshold, such as 50 or 85 \% germination. Currently, these tests are typically scheduled at uniform intervals; testing every 5 years is common. A manager needs to balance the cost of an additional test against the possibility of losing a seed lot due to late retesting. We developed a data-informed method to schedule viability tests for a collection of 2,833 maize seed lots with 3 to 7 completed viability tests per lot. Given these historical data reporting on seed viability at arbitrary times, we fit a hierarchical Bayesian seed-viability model with random seed lot specific coefficients. The posterior distribution of the predicted time to cross below a critical threshold was estimated for each seed lot. We recommend a predicted quantile as a retest time, chosen to balance the importance of catching quickly decaying lots against the cost of premature tests. The method can be used with any seed-viability model; we focused on two, the Avrami viability curve and a quadratic curve that accounts for seed after-ripening. After fitting both models, we found that the quadratic curve gave more plausible predictions than did the Avrami curve. Also, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and a follow-up test demonstrated that a 0.05 quantile yields reasonable predictions.},

Both species possess ‘orthodox’ seed (increasing longevity is observed as either moisture content or temperature are reduced) within the temperature ranges from — 13 to 52°C (Elm) and from —4 to 42°C (Terb) and within the moisture content ranges from 3 to 19 per cent (Elm) and from 5 to 14 per cent (Terb) on a fresh weight basis. Elm seed stored at —75°C showed the expected relationship between longevity and moisture content, but did not differ significantly in longevity from seed kept at — 13°C when moisture contents were held constant. Probit analysis of the relationship between germination percentage and time was performed for each storage environment, yielding a slope from which the standard deviation of the distribution of seed deaths over time (σ) was calculated. Standard deviation values were used in turn to determine the values of constants in a viability equation which had previously been applied to seed of barley, chickpea, cowpea and soybean. The equation, which gave a good fit to the results obtained, can be used to predict viability for seed in storage over a wide range of environmental conditions.Some limitations to the applicability of the viability equation were defined. At 22 per cent and higher moisture contents Elm seed survived longer than predicted. Furthermore, all Elm and Terb seed was killed quickly on placing in —75°C at 22 and 20 per cent moisture content respectively, but high viability was retained for several days at 19 and 17 per cent respectively. Practical implications of the results are discussed.},

Multiple linear regression method was employed to determine the dependency of the viability constants of the probit model on seed composition. Probit equations, already developed for six seed species (barley, chickpea, cowpea, groundnut, sorghum, and soya bean), were used to generate a data set in the ranges of 5–25\% moisture content and −20 to 70 °C temperature. The improved model obtained, called a generalised longevity model, can be used to predict seed viability as a function of initial seed viability, time period, and seed temperature, moisture content, and composition (carbohydrate, lipid, and protein fractions). The average error for predicting seed viability by using the proposed model (5·8\%) was much lower than the average uncertainty of the probit equations (33·9\%). The generalised longevity model could be used for seed species with known composition and unknown viability constants. Further research is recommended to validate the proposed model by using experimental data of different seed species.},

Today man's most important staple foods are derived directly from seeds as they have been since neolithic times. (It is a sobering thought, as Harlan* has pointed out, that nothing significant has been added to his diet since then. ) From those times he must have learned to collect, conserve and cultivate seeds; and the accumulated experience has been handed down. This book then is part of an ancient tradition, for here we are still primarily concerned with these skills. Seeds are plant propagules comprised of embryos in which growth has been suspended, usually supplied with their own food reserves and protected by special covering layers. Typically they are relatively dry structures compared with other plant tissues and, in this condi tion) they are resistant to the ravages of time and their environment. But resistant is a relative tenn and seeds do deteriorate: the type, the extent and the rapidity of the deterioration, and the factors which control it are important to agronomists, horticulturalists, plant breeders, seedsmen, seed analysts, and those concerned with the conservation of genetic resources.},

	abstract = {Seeds from six Kenyan Euphorbia species were placed into experimental storage under open conditions (i.e. not hermetically sealed) over a range of relative humidities (between 25 and 75\%) at 45°C. Viability during storage was assessed at pre-determined intervals and seed viability equation constants estimated. The constants Cw, which quantifies the relative effect of change of moisture content on longevity, and K E, which quantifies inherent longevity were variant between species. Similarly the constants describing the relative effect of change in rh on longevity differed between species. The highest estimate of K E was 10.2 for E. quinquecostata followed by 10.1 for E. pseudoburuana, 8.9 for E. heterochroma, 7.4 for E. heterophylla and 7.3 for E. bussei. The reverse order of the species was observed in the estimates for C W which ranged from 3.96 for E. bussei to 8.09 for E. quinquecostata. These viability constants were used to predict seed longevity following recommended Seed Banking protocols. Longevity was also predicted for seeds stored under ambient conditions at two Kenyan cities, Nairobi and Kisumu, with and without refrigeration at 5°C. These predictions show how even basic refrigeration can improve the longevity of seed stocks destined for short-term storage, for example those required to support academic teaching in universities. Seed stocks destined for long-term conservation should be dried and stored at conditions prevailing in standard gene bank facilities.},

Seeds were sampled from storage for viability determination at different intervals depending on the storage regimens. Viability decline during storage was generally rapid at higher temperature and/or moisture content combinations. The effect of storage conditions on viability was quantified using viability equations. For each of the two species, the estimated periods for viability to fall to 50\% (p50 value) decreased with an increase in the storage temperature and/or moisture content. Viability constants for each of the two species were obtained and used to predict longevity at various non-extreme hypothetical storage conditions. At comparative storage temperature and moisture content combinations, seeds of the two species differed considerably in longevity. The constants obtained in the present study could be applied in predicting storage life of seeds of the two species, especially under short to medium-term storage conditions.},

The Ellis and Roberts model for seed viability during storage is examined, and an inadequacy of the model highlighted. A modification is proposed, based on the ‘control mortality’ probit model developed for insecticide bioassays, to take proper account of variation in initial viability. This new ‘control viability’ model, relating seed viability to storage time, is fitted to data from a carrot seed storage experiment and found to fit well for a range of storage environments. A relationship, similar to that proposed by Ellis and Roberts for the effects of storage conditions on the rate of loss of viability, is fitted to the estimated rates from this new model. Data from a second carrot seed storage experiment are used to validate this relationship.},

	abstract = {Seeds of two ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana, NW20 and N1601, were aged over a range of saturated salt solutions at temperatures between 6 °C and 55 °C. For each ecotype, the results from 37 storage experiments were summarized using the Ellis and Roberts viability equations and a modified version of these equations which allows for a proportion of ‘non‐respondents’. For both models, two approaches were taken in order to model the effect of moisture content (MC) and temperature on seed longevity. The first, a two‐step approach, involved fitting individual survival curves and then multiple regression analysis of the fitted parameters on moisture content and temperature. For the second approach, the full viability models were fitted in one step, including the multiple regression for the effects of MC and temperature within the generalized linear model used to describe each survival curve. This one‐step approach takes into account the full variability of the data and provides the best predictions of seed longevity based on the original assumptions of the Ellis and Roberts viability equations. As a consequence of taking into account all the variation, this one‐step approach is more sensitive and thus more likely to detect changes due to reducing the number of parameters in the model as being significant. Whilst both approaches indicated that seeds from the two Arabidopsis ecotypes have the same response to MC and temperature, parameter values did differ between the approaches, with the one‐step approach providing the better fit. The best model for these two ecotypes, from the one‐step approach, confirmed a quadratic relationship between temperature and longevity, but the magnitude of the non‐linearity is not as large as indicated by the universal value for the quadratic term.},

	abstract = {Probit-based models relating a proportional response variable to a temporal explanatory variable, assuming that the times to response are normally distributed within the population, have been used in seed biology for describing the rate of loss of viability during seed ageing and the progress of germination over time in response to environmental signals (e.g. water, temperature). These models may be expressed as generalized linear models (GLMs) with a probit (cumulative normal distribution) link function, and, using GLM fitting procedures in current statistical software, parameters of these models are efficiently estimated while taking into account the binomial error distribution of the dependent variable. The fitted parameters can then be used to calculate the ‘traditional’ model parameters, such as the hydro- or hydrothermal time constant, the mean or median response of the seeds (e.g. mean time to death, median base water potential), and the standard deviation of the normal distribution of that response. Furthermore, through consideration of the deviance and residuals, performing model evaluation and modification can lead to improved understanding of the underlying physiological/ecological processes. However, fitting a binomial GLM is not appropriate for the cumulative count data often collected from germination studies, as successive observations are not independent, and time-to-event/survival analysis should be considered instead. This review discusses well-known probit-based models, providing advice on how to collect appropriate data and fit the models to those data, and gives an overview of alternative analysis approaches to improve understanding of the underlying mechanisms of seed dormancy and germination behaviour.},

The aim of the present study was to determine whether the seed longevity of two contrasting Australian species could be modelled using the seed viability equation, and whether the universal temperature constants are applicable to these species. Seeds of Eucalyptus erythrocorys F.Muell. (Myrtaceae) and Xanthorrhoea preissii Endl. (Xanthorrhoeaceae) were aged at moisture contents ranging from 3.9 to 15.7\% and temperatures between –20 and 60°C. Survival data were fitted to the seed viability equation in one step and the species constants for each species determined. Both E. erythrocorys and X. preissii seeds exhibited orthodox seed storage behaviour whose longevity could be modelled using the seed viability equation. The viability constants were KE = 8.81, CW = 4.97, CH = 0.0412 and CQ = 0.000379 for E. erythrocorys and KE = 8.77, CW = 5.29, CH = 0.0382 and CQ = 0.000473 for X. preissii. The universal temperature constants could not be used without a significant increase in error. The storage behaviour of these two Australian species is in keeping with that of orthodox species from around the world. Predictions are that E. erythrocorys will be long-lived under gene bank conditions, whereas X. preissii would be moderately long-lived. Current long-term gene bank storage conditions appear suitable for storage of these species; however, recommendations for short-term storage need to be re-evaluated.},

One seed lot of "Kawomo" and two seed lots of IDSA 85, differing in initial quality, were stored hermetically at 50 oC with five (18, 15, 12, 10 and 8\%) moisture contents. In the second investigation, seed of "Kawomo" was stored hermetically at the above moisture contents, but at 30 oC. Both investigations were carried out at the Seed Science Laboratory, Department of Agriculture, The University of Reading, UK.

The knowledge of those species' storability could assist seed conservation and availability. Seed moisture content (mc) was adjusted from initial values either by rehydration above water or by dehydration over silica gel. Seed subsamples of eleven mc for D. nigra (2.5, 2.8, 4.6, 5.3, 7.1, 9.5, 13.3, 14.3, 15.1, 17.4, 18.5\%) and eight mc for D. mollis (1.6, 5.2, 6.9, 8.4, 9.2, 10.6, 11.4, 13.2\%) were hermetically stored at 40, 50 and 65°C (±0.5°C), until complete survival curves were achieved. Both species had orthodox behaviour during storage, although D. mollis presented higher storability, probably due to hardseededness and different seed composition. An inverse relationship was observed between mc and seed longevity for the species. Viability constants for D. nigra and D. mollis were: KE = 5.199, 6.282; CW  = 4.524, 3.838; CH = 0.08175, 0.05405; CQ  = 0.001641, 0.001316.

	abstract = {A crescente conscientização da sociedade para os problemas ecológicos vem proporcionando um considerável aumento na demanda por sementes e mudas de espécies nativas. O Balfourodendron riedelianum (Engler) Engler é uma espécie lenhosa nativa, de importância econômica, paisagística e ecológica, popularmente conhecida como pau marfim. Objetivou-se, neste estudo, identificar a temperatura ideal para germinação e determinar o potencial fisiológico de sementes desta espécie, colhidas de diferentes procedências. Objetivou-se também verificar o comportamento das sementes com relação ao armazenamento, predizer o período de armazenamento destas sementes e determinar as constantes da equação de longevidade. Foram estudadas sementes, colhidas em Marechal Cândido Rondon, Entre Rios do Oeste e Diamante D Oeste/PR. Para avaliação da germinação, foram utilizadas duas temperaturas, 25 oC constante e 20-30 oC alternada, com fotoperíodo de 16-8 horas, e como substrato o papel tipo germitest. Armazenou-se, por 360 dias, os frutos em duas diferentes embalagens (saco de papel Kraft e vidro) e em dois diferentes ambientes (controlado e não controlado). O delineamento, utilizado, foi inteiramente casualizado Foram avaliadas as variáveis: comprimento de frutos, massa de mil frutos, porcentagem de germinação, primeira contagem de germinação, índice de velocidade de germinação, grau de umidade e comprimento de plântulas. Os períodos de armazenagem foram: 0, 90, 180, 270 e 360 dias após o beneficiamento dos frutos. Para a elaboração das equações de longevidade determinou-se as constantes que compõem a equação através de curvas de regressão. A germinação das sementes de Balfourodendron riedelianum (Engler) Engler, não sofreu efeito da temperatura constante de 25 oC, quando comparadas com temperaturas alternadas de 20-30 oC. O comprimento das plântulas de pau marfim, não foi influenciado pelas temperaturas de 25 oC constante e temperatura alternada de 20-30 oC, a partir de 90 dias de armazenamento. Entre as procedências, a Entre Rios do Oeste destacou-se das demais aos 0 e 360 dias, quando apresentou os maiores valores de velocidade de germinação. Os frutos, armazenados em embalagens de vidro e em local sem controle das condições ambientais, não apresentaram variações relacionadas ao teor de água, evidenciando, assim, a melhor maneira de armazenar frutos de pau marfim. Os valores da massa de mil frutos de pau marfim foram 329,5 g, 585,5 g e 450,0 g para as procedências Marechal Cândido Rondon, Entre Rios do Oeste e Diamante D Oeste, respectivamente. Para sementes de pau marfim, as constantes encontradas a fim de predizer a longevidade foram: Ke= 2,8667; Cw=9,7697E-013; Ch=1,3435E-012 e Cq=1,1651E-013. Para as condições de armazenamento com temperaturas médias de 23 oC ou de 15 oC, e as sementes de pau marfim apresentando grau de umidade médio de 12\%, podem ser armazenadas pelo período de até 2 anos. Os valores da Correlação de Pearson entre a porcentagem de germinação real e a porcentagem de germinação calculada foram 73\% e 76\%, para as procedências Entre Rios do Oeste e Diamante D Oeste, e 77\% e 74\%, para ambiente não controlado e ambiente controlado, respectivamente},

The objective of this investigation was to quantify relationship between temperatures and seed moisture on seed deterioration and determination viability constants in sorghum. Four storage temperatures (5, 15, 25 and 35oC) and three moister content levels (6, 10 and 14\%) were used. We carry out coefficients viability with use of Ellis and Roberts equation and were compared using Probit analysis. Process of germination of Sorghum seeds indicated that germination percentage decreased as the storage period progressed. Increased of moister and temperature of storage decreased germination.  Germination percentage of seeds with 14\% moisture content stored at 35oC and 6\% moister was 11\%. According to the results, seeds with 6\% moisture content stored at 5oC and 6\% moister content had the highest germination percentage and the least deteriorated state even after 200 days. Estimates of KE, CW, CH and CQ were 2.49, -0.30019, 0.00725 and -0.00057 respectively. Moreover, our results provide convincing evidence that storage in various storage conditions can reduced seed viability.  Also the results show that with increasing in moisture content, in each temperature, especially in high temperature, seed longevity decrease, is higher with increase in moisture content.},

	abstract = {One of the most common methods for conservation of plant genetic resources is their ex situ storage as seed gene banks. Seeds that are stored in the gene banks must be regenerated due to exchange and seed deterioration; if they not be regenerated the potential benefits of infrastructure investments for germplasm ex situ conservation may not be attained. Prediction of seed longevity is based on viability equation that has four constants which are species specific. The aim of this project was estimation of these constants and then using them for predicting the regeneration time of Thymus transcaspicus,T. daenensis,Salvia officinalis, Satureja hortensis, Dracocephalum moldavica, Descurainia sophia,Eruca sativa andMelilotus officinalis. The seeds were placed in three environments with relative humidity of 20, 40 and 60\% and their moisture content was measured after equilibrium. Then the seeds sealed in nylon pockets and stored at 30, 35 and 40 ºC. The TP germination tests with three replications were done monthly. The Excel software was used for estimation of viability constants (i.e. KE, Cw , CH, CQ). The KE was estimated 5.065, 5, 5, 4.46, 3.837, 4.33 and 4.21 for T. transcaspicus, T. daenensis, Salvia officinalis, Satureja hortensis, Dracocephalum moldavica, Descurainia sophia, Eruca sativa and Melilotus officinalis respectively. The maximum and minimum seed longevity estimated for T. transcaspicus and Eruca sativa respectively. If viability be 100\% at the beginning of the storage, the seeds of T. transcaspicus and E. sativa with 8\% moisture content in the active collection (5 ºC) must be regenerated after 123 and 15 years respectively.},

	abstract = {Conservation of okra [Abelmoschus esculentus (L.) Moench] germplasm is mainly by seed storage in gene banks. Efficient management of seed collections, especially under tropical conditions, requires the ability to quantify and predict seed viability during storage. To quantify longevity of okra seed for purposes of viability prediction, two controlled deterioration (CD) experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, seed of six accessions of okra were stored at 45°C and 60\% relative humidity (RH), and germination determined at 0, 3, 5, 10, 20 35, 50, 70, and 100 days to estimate probit seed longevity parameters. Mean probit seed longevity (P50) was 102.59 ± 38.21 days, indicating that okra seed are long-lived compared to a longevity marker species, Brassica napus (L.). In the second experiment, constants of a model for predicting viability were determined for okra seed stored for 300 days at 45°C and 2.19 to 12.9\% seed moisture content (MC). The fit of log σ and log MC was R 2 = 0.90 when log σ data for okra seed dried below 4.09\% MC were not included in the fit. Estimates of derived viability constants were K E = 6.659 and C W = 2.448. Estimated viability constants should be used for viability predictions under typical tropical ambient storage and practical gene bank storage conditions.},

	abstract = {Background and AimsExtended seed longevity in the dry state is the basis for the ex situ conservation of ‘orthodox’ seeds. However, even under identical storage conditions there is wide variation in seed life-span between species. Here, the effects of seed traits and environmental conditions at the site of collection on seed longevity is explored for195 wild species from 71 families from environments ranging from cold deserts to tropical forests.MethodsSeeds were rapidly aged at elevated temperature and relative humidity (either 45°C and 60\% RH or 60°C and 60\% RH) and regularly sampled for germination. The time taken in storage for viability to fall to 50\% (p50) was determined using Probit analysis and used as a measure of relative seed longevity between species.Key ResultsAcross species, p50 at 45°C and 60\% RH varied from 0·1 d to 771 d. Endospermic seeds were, in general, shorter lived than non-endospermic seeds and seeds from hot, dry environments were longer lived than those from cool, wet conditions. These relationships remained significant when controlling for the effects of phylogenetic relatedness using phylogenetically independent contrasts. Seed mass and oil content were not correlated with p50.ConclusionsThe data suggest that the endospermic seeds of early angiosperms which evolved in forest understorey habitats are short-lived. Extended longevity presumably evolved as a response to climatic change or the invasion of drier areas. The apparent short-lived nature of endospermic seeds from cool wet environments may have implications for re-collection and re-testing strategies in ex situ conservation.},

	abstract = {The main goal of seed storage is to maintain its quality from harvesting to sowing time. Among all factors, storage temperature and seed moisture content are the most important factors affecting seed longevity. This experiment was conducted at University of Tehran, Department of Agronomy and Plant Breeding during 1394 to determine the Ellis and Roberts deterioration model of Chenopodium quinoa seeds and introduce constants of viability equation. Seed viability and initial moisture content was measured and after that seeds were adjusted to 5, 9, 13 and 17\% moisture content and sealed hermetically in Nano packets. Storage temperatures were 5, 15, 25 and 35˚ C. The interval of sampling depended on the storage conditions. Seed viability constants were estimated to predict seed longevity in this species and relationship between sigma and moisture content and temperatures was determined. After probit analysis, survival curves were depicted in each condition. Results showed that seeds with 5\% moisture content stored at 5° C had the highest germination percentage, and after 8 months seed viability decreased from 98\% to 94\%. But, seeds which were stored at 17\% moisture content and 25 and 35° C had the highest deterioration rate. Estimates of KE, CW, CH and CQ were 2. 93, 0. 51, 0. 019 and 0. 00031, respectively.
