\description{
\code{Ke} computes the viability constant \mjseqn{K_{E}} from the
species-specific temperature coefficients in case of storage experiments
conducted at constant temperature and varying moisture contents. \loadmathjax
}
\details{
From seed storage experiments involving storage of seeds at a constant
temperature in a range of moisture contents, the effect of moisture content
on seed longevity (\mjseqn{\sigma}) can be estimated from the following
linear relationship:

\mjsdeqn{\log{\sigma} = K - C_{w}\log{m}}

Where, \mjseqn{K} is the intercept, \mjseqn{C_{W}} is the slope and
\mjseqn{m} is the moisture content.

The constant \mjseqn{K} associated with the relationship of temperature with
seed longevity as follows.

\mjsdeqn{K = K_{E} - C_{H}t - C_{Q}t^{2}}

Where, \mjseqn{K_{E}}, \mjseqn{C_{H}} and \mjseqn{C_{Q}} are the
species-specific seed viability constants.

The constant \mjseqn{K_{E}} can be estimated from the universal temperature
constants (\mjseqn{C_{H}} = 0.0329 and \mjseqn{C_{Q}} = 0.000478) in case of
seed storage experiments at constant temperature and varying moisture content
as follows.

\mjsdeqn{K_{E} = K + C_{H}t + C_{Q}t^{2}}
