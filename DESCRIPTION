Description: An implementation of the improved seed viability equations of 
    Ellis and Roberts (1980) <doi:10/gcshwj> and its modification by Mead and 
    Grey (1999) <doi:10/gcsgt7> for seed viability curve fitting and 
    calculation of several seed viability metrics such as storage period, final 
    viability, storage moisture content, storage temperature and days to loose 
    one probit viability. The package further includes various conversions and 
    transformations associated with seed viability calculations.
