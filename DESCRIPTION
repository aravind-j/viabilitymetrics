Description: An implementation of viability equations of Ellis and Roberts 
    (1980) <doi:10/gcshwj> and Mead and Grey (1999) <doi:10/gcsgt7> for seed
    viability curve fitting and calculation of several seed viability metrics
    such as storage period, final viability, storage moisture content, storage
    temperature and days to loose one probit viablity. The package further
    includes various conversions and transformations associated with seed
    viability calculations.
