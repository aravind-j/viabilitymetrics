Description: An implementation of viability equation of Ellis and Roberts (1980)
    for calculation of several seed viability metrics such as storage period,
    final viability, storage moisture content, storage temperature and days to
    loose one probit viablity. The package further includes various conversions
    and transformations associated with seed viability calculations.
